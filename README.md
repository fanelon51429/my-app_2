// HERE is a the benefit of using the particular tools mentioned above:
Rubies are said to focus energy, shielding the owner or wearer from negative thoughts or experiences, including physical or psychological attacks. They are said to promote clear thinking, allowing the subconscious to work with the conscious mind.
//A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.
The database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data.

Retirement of legacy assets is in particular driven by analyzing the remaining dependencies on these assets.
